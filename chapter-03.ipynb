    "One of the simplest uses of the _transformers_ library is to load a pre-trained model and use it for inference. Let's use the BERT model for a sentiment analysis task. We will first import the _pipeline_ module from the _transformers_ library. The _pipeline_ module abstract a lot of details away for us and makes it easy to load a pre-trained model for NLP tasks. Then we use the task _sentiment_analysis_ to automatically select and load a model that is trained on sentiment analysis tasks. There are a lot of other tasks available like _text-generation_ (full list: https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline.task) and we can also specify a specific model to be selected by the _pipeline_. We then apply the classifier model returned by the _pipeline_ to a sentence to determine its sentiment."
